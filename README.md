A simple Spring Boot CRUD web application for managing a catalog of products using MySQL as the backend and Thymeleaf for the UI. The application allows users to create, update, delete and view.
The project follows a clean separation of concerns with:
1. A Controller layer to handle HTTP requests and render views.
2. A Service layer for business logic.
3. A Repository layer for database access using Spring Data JPA.
4. An Entity class representing the product.
